            <p class="description">Description: I'm gonna be outright with this and say that I'm not a giant fan of AI art, mainly because of the ethics with taking art from people without consent among other things, but I had decided to set that aside for now to create this cover. I start off with choosing a genre with my classmate - we ended up deciding on a dystopian mystery - then asking ChatGPT to generate almost everything about it: The title, the tags, even the author's name. Then, after all that was processed, I took the information from ChatGPT and tried to fit it into a description that could be used to generate a proper image. Once all that was said and done, all it took was to run it through Photoshop, adjust the image's color values and add text that felt like it was coming from the genre, and call it a day.</p>
