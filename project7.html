            <p class="description">Description: This was a fun one! I once again had to come up with a fun concept that would best suit this project, and came up with a pirate ship from a bird's eye perspective - really inspired by one piece. Then I tried to initially draw the idea and sketch it out in Clip Studio Paint, before realizing I might have to opt for pre-made assets. I found some great looking ones in the Adobe library that really captured the aesthetic and idea I was going for, and then I ported it to Illustrator to get it prepped for Animate. Finally, after a bit of keyframing and coming up with the whale shadow just to portray the use of a size slider keyframe, I've got another project I'm really fond of!</p>
