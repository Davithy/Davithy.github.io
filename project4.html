            <p class="description">Description: For this video, I had to create a short montage of 12 months that depicts a passage of time, hence the title name. First, I had to pick out a song, and nothing feels like time has passed like the Minecraft soundtrack. Then, while picking out clips, I began to relate a lot to what I was picking and eventually chose my own experiences to be the theme of the video. The first clip was a seed growing, to indicate that time was passing. By the second month we're already showing someone who's basically on their phone, on their computer, being attached to the screen all the time. By the time half the year has gone, they decide to turn off and disconnect from their screens and take a trip. By the end, I had no idea what my December would turn out, but I decided to bring it full circle to how the video started. I also tried to sync the video cuts with the music, but overall it ended up being very personal to me.</p>
