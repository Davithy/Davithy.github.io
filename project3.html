            <p class="description">Description: To start, I had to pick out three animals that all had really distinct features. I actually asked friends to see what animals they came up with and they came up with a great trio: a secretary bird, an elephant shrew, and a guanaco. I then spent a good amount of time looking through Adobe's stock image library to pick out really detailed photos of each animal. The secretary bird had a great head, so of course I had to make that the defining trait that stayed and the elephant shrew has quite the tail on it, so both traits were then stitched on to the body of the guanaco. To complete it, I picked out an orange from the guanaco coat for the background.</p>
