            <p class="description">Description: Unlike the Passage of Time, we were already provided with four sets of a series of clips to choose from, and were tasked with giving them audio. Among the four, I was mostly interested in the one that depicted several dancing people, but I thought giving them music to sync to their dancing was far too easy of a task. I spent quite a bit of time scouring Youtube's free audio vidoes just to find a footstep that sounded like it was in the right environment, and I played a bit with the audio effects of Premiere, BUT in the end I think the results speak for themselves! It was a fun assignment to tackle. </p>
